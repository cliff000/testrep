London Bridge is falling down,
Falling down, Falling down.
London Bridge is falling down,
My fair lady.

ロンドン橋落ちる　落ちる　落ちる
ロンドン橋落ちる　可愛いお嬢さん

How will we build it up,
Build it up, Build it up,
How will we build it up,
My fair lady?

どうやって建てる　建てる　建てる
どうやって建てる　可愛いお嬢さん

Build it up with gold and silver,
gold and silver, gold and silver.
Build it up with gold and silver,
My fair lady.

Gold and silver I have none,
I have none, I have none.
Gold and silver I have none,
My fair lady.
